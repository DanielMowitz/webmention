//! # webmention
//!
//! Provides support for sending and receiving webmentions. [Webmention](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/)
//! is a W3C recommendation for notifying that a link from one URL to another was published.
//!
//! In short: to receive webmentions you need to process POST requests with `source` and `target`
//! on advertised endpoint URL. There are various ways to advertise your endpoint, the simplest of all
//! is to place `<link rel="webmention" href="endpoint_url">` inside of your document.
//!
//! To send webmentions you need to discover endpoint and send a POST request with
//! `source` and `target` payload.
//!
//! ## CLI tool
//!
//! There is a CLI tool available with support for sending webmentions, and (optionally) a simple endpoint
//! based on Rocket.
